The actions are among government, enterprises, and NGOs to help them better understand the benefits of adopting open source, and promote the importance of open data to the public sphere. OCF’s belief is that a culture of open collaboration is the foundation for an innovative society, and the engine of a participatory democracy.\nSince its establishment, OCF has supported local communities to run large-scale conferences, seminars, and hackathons, as well as collaborate with a number of international offices and multilateral institutions to deepen Taiwan’s connection to the global open culture community. The past collaboration partners include the American Institute in Taiwan, British Office Taipei, Bureau Francais de Taipei, and the World Bank. OCF also has strong connections with the global open source community, and regularly exchanges experiences with civic tech groups worldwide. The mission is to build bridges between local and global “open” communities, and hope to act as a mediator for open culture.","logo":"http://summit.g0v.tw/2016/5cf29df68544752d68898a0bae6d5e66.png"},"object":{"@id":"g0v-summit-2016"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"JoinAction","agent":{"@type":"Organization","name":"mySociety","url":"https://www.mysociety.org/","description":"mySociety is a not-for-profit social enterprise, based in the UK and working internationally.
